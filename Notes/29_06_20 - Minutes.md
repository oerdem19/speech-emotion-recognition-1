# Meeting 29/06/2020 - 3:00 pm

Discussed the main conceptual methods of progressing with the project

## Discussed need for fallbacks
	- What if there is something that a technical solution cannot achieve
	** This has mostly been dealt with in scoping time regarding speech recognition solution

## Discussed need for available solutions if entire system is to be completed
	- May be best to start cutting potential features such as 'real-time' input
	- Using non-live content, pre-recorded files allows for a proof of concept without concern over audio processing limitations of the various system which may be utilised.

## Focus for this week should be in significantly limiting scope and defining an aspect of the system which could be standalone.
	- Try to enable this standalone aspect to function without the need for significant pre-recorded gameplay voice audio
