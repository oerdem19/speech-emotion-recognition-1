During the initial meeting in-depth discussion regarding presentation topics -
	"system which uses language processing to ‘clean-up’ audio input from players, providing more useful prompts and a more standardised experience for the player."

##	* Discussed viability of idea, along with main stumbling blocks.
		- Latency (could the system operate while mainting useful communication)
		- Data for development (difficulty in obtaining training data)

##	* Discussed potential of using social signal processing theory
		- Focus more on behavoural/emotive triggers to influence the 'mixing' of voice communication
		- Tackles the same issues as a speech recognition system (improvement of user experience/competency)
		- Breadth of literature supporting ideas
		- Potentially more achieveable development goals

##	* Discussed evaluation testing procedures/solutions
		- User testing
			+ Potential to use metrics such as percieved competency/performance
			+ Team stability? (feeling of cohesion)

##	* Discussed ethics considerations
		- Avoid use of anon' data collected online to negate potential vetting issues
		- General user testing OK with consent
